Kenney Jam:
    Need to have:
        
        Transformation/Cameras/Coordinate-systems:
            ✔ Include GLM
            ✔ View matrix (cameras)
            ✔ Model-matrix

        ✔ Keyboard events

        Text Rendering:
            ✔ Setup FreeType library
            ✔ Textureatlas
            ☐ Test simple font rendering

        
        ☐ Test on seperate computer
        ☐ Setup renderer system in Game class
        ☐ Licenses

    Nice to have:
        ☐ Mouse event
        ☐ Setup timestep (temporary)
        ☐ Particle system (simple version)
        ☐ Sound system
        ☐ FPS measurement
        ☐ Debug log?

☐ Change coordinate system direction so positive y-axis is down
☐ Move Shader (textured quad shader) as a singleton
☐ FPS measurement
☐ Implement instrumentation
☐ ImGUI ? (Perhaps implement for easier testing)
☐ Proper logging
☐ Font atlas
☐ Draw Sprite rotated and flipped

Text Rendering:

☐ Create ShaderLoader class
☐ Circle renderer
☐ Line renderer


☐ Collision system
Maybe part of the ECS?

☐ Create proper time stepping

☐ Camera linear zoom
Make the zoom on the camera linear, such that negative values is a zoom out, and positive are zoom in, and each value zooms the same amount.



Notes:

    - Text
        - Font
        - Position
        - Text

    renderText(string text, string font, unsigned int size, float x, float y, HorizontalAlignment alignement, VerticalAlignment alignment ){

    }
